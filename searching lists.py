# How would you modify the hash table into a dictionary?
# In order to convert the HashList so that it uses a dictionary instead is first
change the
# constructor so that it creates a dictionary with the keys being numbers in
ascending order and
# the items for those keys being None. The hashfunction, put, and item methods
would stay the same with only
# minor changes but the contains method could use the contains (in) to make the
runtime from O(n) to O(1).
